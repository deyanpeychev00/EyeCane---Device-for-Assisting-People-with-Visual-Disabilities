# EyeCane - Device for Assisting People with Visual Disabilities

The aim of this project is to help people with visual disabilities and facilitate their daily lives.
 
The project consists of a device with software, based on Arduino microcontroller, which measures distance by ultrasonic sensor. 
The signals are assigned to the user via vibrations and sound signals with different frequencies, depending on the measured distance from the device to the object in front of it.

This device can help people with visual disabilities to become more independent by cutting the need of a person to assist their movement in the environment or the need of a guide dog.
